                           ==============

Coredump feature enable coredump of user-space processes except
Android applications handled by zygote which explicitly avoid
coredumps.

Coredumps are generated under /data/logs/core/ folder.

If crashlogd is enabled (debug-crashlogd mixin group), it will create
an event and move them out in dedicated folder per coredump, tracked
on its side, see debug-crashlogd/README for details.


Debug only mixins consideration
-------------------------------

This feature is part of 'debug-*' groups, which are dedicated to debug
and product stabilisation, thus do not target final products and user
builds.

As per build variant (eng, userdebug, user) dedicated files feature is
not available with mixins, per option files are provided in
'device/intel/common/debug/' folder and will be included at build time
regarding selected option.

Enable coredump
------------------------------
After coredump is enabled, there are too many tombstones, this will fill data partion full.
the coredump data dump is disabled by default.
To enable coredump data dump, just set variable 'data_dump' to true in mixins.spec.
data_dump is set to false by default.

eg: for gordon_peak
add below line in /device/intel/broxton/gordon_peak/mixins.spec
debug-coredump: true(data_dump=true)
